<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Sophomore at the University of Miami. Public Relations Major, Sports Administration Minor. Previously interned at Amerasport LLC doing design work and social media, current camp counselor at Camp Young Judaea. I like to travel and am fluent in Hebrew. I have been to Israel five times. I lived in Israel for a semester my junior year of high school through the Alexander Muss American High School in Israel program. I spend my time reading and trying to find new music. I like photography interested in photo journalism. Ideally I see myself doing public relations for a sport team, preferably in my hometown of Boston. I like public relations because it is a career that will allow me to make connections, plan events and and put my love of talking to good use. I was on the regional board of New England United Synagogue Youth, I was the Vice President of Programming and Israel affairs for a one year term. That position helped me hone my leadership skills as well as allowed me to be a role model for younger high schoolers.</p>
